### Hi there! I'm Jose ðŸ‘‹
I build software that helps organizations trust and scale their data with confidence. With over a decade of experience across cloud platforms, distributed systems, and data infrastructure, I focus on turning complex challenges into clear, maintainable, and scalable solutions.

I thrive in hands-on technical leadershipâ€”designing architecture, writing production code, and shaping engineering decisions that improve performance, resilience, and developer experience. I enjoy collaborating across teams to align technical execution with product goals and long-term vision.

My expertise spans backend systems, infrastructure-as-code, and real-time data processing primarily using Python, Scala, and Java, and building with Spark, Kubernetes, and Terraform. I care deeply about engineering culture, code quality, and building systems that are dependable, scalable, and easy to evolve.
