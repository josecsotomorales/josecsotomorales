### Hi there! I'm Jose ðŸ‘‹
I build software that helps organizations work with data more reliably, at scale, and with greater confidence. With over a decade of experience across cloud platforms, distributed systems, and data infrastructure, I focus on turning complex challenges into clear, maintainable, and scalable solutions.

I thrive in technical leadership roles where I can stay deeply involvedâ€”designing system architecture, writing production code, and guiding engineering decisions that drive performance, resilience, and a better developer experience. I enjoy working across teams to align technical execution with product goals and long-term vision.

My expertise spans backend development, infrastructure as code, and real-time data processing. I work primarily with Python, Scala, and Java, and regularly build with tools like Apache Spark, Kubernetes, and Terraform. I care about code quality, engineering culture, and building systems that are dependable and easy to evolve.
